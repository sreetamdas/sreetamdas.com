Here's a couple of other things that I love working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): can't believe I put off working on Next,js for so long; it is an absolute delight!
- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start): full-stack React without giving up route-level control
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): utility-first styling that keeps iteration fast
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): type-safe code means that refactoring and catching bugs at code-write time itself becomes the norm
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest): makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in React apps a breeze
- [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1): lightweight SQL at the edge for things like page view counters

and a couple of packages that I've been keeping an eye out for:

- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev): a fast formatter + linter experience with excellent TypeScript support
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): taking the concepts of [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to a whole another level
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev): component framework which unlike React and Vue (which primarily run in the browser), runs during the _compile step at build time_
