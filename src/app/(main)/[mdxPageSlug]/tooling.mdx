Here's a couple of other things that I love working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): can't believe I put off working on Next,js for so long; it is an absolute delight!
- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com): CSS-in-JS _just works_
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): type-safe code means that refactoring and catching bugs at code-write time itself becomes the norm
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com): makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com): hosted Postgres database with authentication, instant APIs, edge functions, realtime subscriptions and storage—not to mention their (very impressive) commitment to open-source!

and a couple of packages that I've been keeping an eye out for:

- [Rome](https://rome.tools): an approach to "standardizing the web development experience" by consolidating a linter, compiler, bundler, and more for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, Markdown, and CSS.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): taking the concepts of [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to a whole another level
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev): component framework which unlike React and Vue (which primarily run in the browser), runs during the _compile step at build time_
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com): CSS framework with a focus on utility classes instead of prebuilt components
