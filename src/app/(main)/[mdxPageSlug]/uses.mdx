  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) for everything work related
  - [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari) to make sure whatever I build works across browsers, and when I need to conserve my battery usage (Safari is _incredibly_ battery-efficient)
  - ~~[Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer) for development/sandboxed work~~

## Helper apps

- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) super useful when you want to prevent your system from falling asleep
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) a better alternative for a growing list of apps:
  - ~~[Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket)~~ emojis, everywhere!
  - ~~[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com)~~ a much better Spotlight
  - ~~[Maccy](https://maccy.app)~~ for lack of better words, a copy-paste manager? allows you to search through your historical copy-s, super helpful
  - ~~[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)~~ a window manager; I love that I can arrange my windows exactly how I want using just keyboard shortcuts
- [1Password](https://1password.com) password manager which really checks off all the right boxes
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) Keyboard customizer with Caps Lock enhancement

## VS Code Extensions

I believe that the tools and tooling that you use _does_ play a role in making you a more efficient programmer, and a couple of mostly quality-of-life extensions that I use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) are:

- [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) highlight the entire line wherever a diagnostic is generated and print the message inline.
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) Find out who to blame quickerâ€”spoiler, it's you.
- [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) search your workspace for comment tags like `TODO` and `FIXME`, and display them in a tree view. ðŸŒ³
- [Karma](/karma) Duh.
