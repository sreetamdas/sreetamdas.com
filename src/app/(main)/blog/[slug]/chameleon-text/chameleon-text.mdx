I recently created a [new page on this website](/fancy-pants). From an early time in my front-end journey, I have been amazed by the websites that are featured on [awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/freelance-portfolio/) and I wanted to create something <Sparkles>**_fancy_**</Sparkles> like them.

Here's how I did it.

## What we want to build

Let's take a look again at what we're trying to build here:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ChameleonHighlight className="font-bold leading-normal -tracking-[0.065em] [font-size:clamp(4rem,_10vw,_10rem)]">Hello there!</ChameleonHighlight>

<InfoBlock>
Let's break down what's happening here:

- Text color transitions from one color to another.
- As soon as it reaches the "target" color, we change it again to keep it changing.

</InfoBlock>

## Changing colors

We can animate the color changing of the text by using `transition`:

```css
transition-property: color;
transition-duration: 5s;
transition-timing-function: linear;

/* or in one line */
transition: color 5s linear;
```

And since I'm using `styled-components`, we can put this in a re-usable CSS string:

```tsx
import { css } from "styled-components";

const WaveMixin = css`
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 5s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
`;
```

But this doesn't do anything at the moment â€” to actually change the color, we will need to update the color of the `<span>` that we are targeting _after_ it has been rendered to the screen.

Let's start writing our little wrapper component for this:

```tsx
// usage
<ChameleonHighlight>Hello there!</ChameleonHighlight>;

const ChameleonHighlight = ({ children }) => <Wave>{children}</Wave>;

// import styled, { css } from "styled-components";
const WaveMixin = css`
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 5s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
`;

const Wave = styled.span`
  ${WaveMixin}
`;
```

And now we change the color once the component has mounted:

```tsx highlight="3-11,14-19,21-23"
<ChameleonHighlight>Hello there!</ChameleonHighlight>;

let root: HTMLElement;

const getNewColor = () => {
  const h = random(1, 360);
  const s = random(80, 90);
  const l = random(50, 60);

  return `hsl(${h}, ${s}%, ${l}%)`;
};

const ChameleonHighlight = ({ children }) => {
  const changeColor = () => {
    const newColor = getNewColor();

    if (root === undefined) root = document?.documentElement;
    root.style.setProperty("--color-chameleon", newColor);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    changeColor();
  }, []);

  return <Wave>{children}</Wave>;
};

const WaveMixin = css`
  color: var(--color-chameleon);
  transition-property: color;
  transition-duration: 5s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
`;

const Wave = styled.span`
  ${WaveMixin}
`;
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<HighlightWithUseEffect className="font-bold leading-normal -tracking-[0.065em] [font-size:clamp(4rem,_10vw,_10rem)]">Hello there!</HighlightWithUseEffect>

Huh, that didn't seem to work out ðŸ¤” but that's because the transition already ran since the above live example was already "mounted" by the time you scrolled down to it.

## A wild custom hook appeared!

To keep changing the color after a pre-defined interval, we'll be defining our very own `useInterval` custom hook:

```tsx
const useInterval = (callback, delay) => {
  const savedCallback = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    savedCallback.current = callback;
  }, [callback]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = (...args) => savedCallback.current(...args);

    if (delay !== null) {
      const intervalId = setInterval(handler, delay);
      return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
    }
  }, [delay]);
};
```

Let's now use this hook to change the color of our text just as it completes its transition.

```tsx highlight="1,15-17"
import { useInterval } from "@/utils/hooks";

const ChameleonHighlight = ({ children }) => {
  const changeColor = () => {
    const newColor = getNewColor();

    if (root === undefined) root = document?.documentElement;
    root.style.setProperty("--color-chameleon", newColor);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    changeColor();
  }, []);

  useInterval(() => {
    changeColor();
  }, 5000);

  return <Wave>{children}</Wave>;
};
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<HighlightWithUseInterval className="font-bold leading-normal -tracking-[0.065em] [font-size:clamp(4rem,_10vw,_10rem)]">**Hello there!**</HighlightWithUseInterval>

Voila! âœ¨

There we go. What's great is that you can also use this to highlight link, like so:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<ChameleonHighlight className="font-bold leading-normal -tracking-[0.065em] [font-size:clamp(4rem,_10vw,_10rem)]">
{/* prettier-ignore */}
  <a href="#" className="visited:no-underline hover:underline hover:decoration-current hover:decoration-solid focus-visible:outline-dashed focus-visible:outline-8 focus-visible:outline-secondary">This is a link.</a>
</ChameleonHighlight>

## Wrapping up

I'm really glad with how the effect turned out, and it was also easier to accomplish because I was using CSS-in-JS. It's great to see how powerful tools like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com) can be!
You can [check the effect out in action](/fancy-pants) and see it in all its glory ðŸ˜„

Have a good one ðŸ‘‹
