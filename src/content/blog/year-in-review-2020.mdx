2020 was a weird year for us all, but here's everything that I was able to do this year anyway:

## Finally launched my blog!

At the beginning of 2020, I set out to redo my personal website. I was fairly impressed with how I’d built it ([over-engineered](/blog/over-engineering-a-blog) and such), and also with how my blog post — which was a big motivation for revamping my website in the first place — had started to take shape. After months of work (and procrastination), I published my blog post in late November.

I crossposted it to [dev.to](https://dev.to/sreetamdas/the-perfect-dark-mode-2d7g) and [Hashnode](https://sreetamdas.hashnode.dev/the-perfect-dark-mode), and posted it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/jywex9/the_perfect_dark_mode_in_nextjs/) as well. It also got picked up by [React Status](https://react.statuscode.com/issues/217) and the [Stack Overflow newsletter](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/12/11/17089/#h-links-from-around-the-web)!

I'd planned quite a bit for its release, but that still didn't prepare me for the sheer number of people who read my blog post — between all three platforms that I posted on, over <Highlight>15 thousand</Highlight> checked out the post!

Here's what I wanna say to you — if you've got _that one article_ that you've been sitting on for weeks/months, get it out there! You'd be surprised at how many people find it intriguing :&rpar;

## Became more active on Twitter

There's tons of great content on Twitter _if you're following the right people_ — I realised that in a year without much physical interaction with people, Twitter is a great outlet for thinking out loud; I got loads of feedback and motivation from people. Heck, I even got a job interview just because I was following someone who posted about it! The highlight of it all was getting followed by [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify) and [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo)!

## Got a new job!

Late last year I [started working](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1326004455397969920) at [Remote](https://remote.com), a company that is everything I'd ever dreamed of. It really does "walk the talk" of working remote and async!

We also have a [public handbook](https://handbook.remote.com) that I recommend checking out! ([Our number one value is kindness](https://www.notion.so/remotecom/Values-d43475e8895c4b7c811490aef64782b3) 🙂)

## A Year of Firsts

Working from home (for so long!) was a first for a lot of us, but in addition, I also:

- got a [chance to speak at a conf](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1342839171287666691) for the first time (which got [postponed to March '21](https://reactday.in) 😭)
- got to [play in VR](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas/status/1336932419497197569) (thanks [@Remote](https://remote.com)!) It is one thing to read up and/or watch LTT videos about it, but nothing prepares you for the moment when you get to experience it firsthand

- took part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), albeit I could only keep up for nine days; You can find my solutions [here](https://gist.github.com/sreetamdas/a094dc7cc17b75dc7563e04240cf5618)
- Got more into mechanical keyboards

- started doing the [New York Times Mini Crossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini) _almost_ regularly
- treated myself for 2020 with the [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4)

- released [Karma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SreetamD.karma): a custom theme for VSCode, and I'm so so proud that it was good enough for 2500+ people to install it!

I'm not great at keeping resolutions, but I came up with a list of things that I hope to do in 2021:

- Become better at fullstack develop and build an app, no matter the size
- Learn in public
- Help more people learn how to code (and get better myself)
- Be more consistent with posts on my blog and my newsletter
- Hopefully get to speak at offline events and also conquer my stage fright (or whatever's left of it)
- Get better at CSGO ([reach out](https://twitter.com/_SreetamDas) to me if you wanna [play](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sreetamdas) along with me!)
- ~~Improve my Remote work setup (should have some updates soon!)~~ I received my setup! You can also check out my [/uses](/uses) page!
