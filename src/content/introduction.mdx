I'm a Senior software tinkerer currently working at [Remote](https://remote.com). I enjoy working on <PrimaryGradient><Heavy>React + TypeScript</Heavy></PrimaryGradient> and am a big believer in the functional programming paradigm—lately, I've been interested in working with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and the [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org). In the past I've also worked with [Python](https://github.com/sreetamdas/streak-saviour) and dabbled with [C++](https://github.com/sreetamdas/2048), as well as Django and Redux.

I love open source and try my best to contribute whenever I get a chance — I also do my (small) part by [open sourcing this website](https://github.com/sreetamdas/sreetamdas.com)! Additionally, I enjoy mechanical keyboards (check out my [keebs](/keebs)!) and CS:GO, and will gladly discuss them at length. 😄

This website is my lil' project-cum-labour of love, where I like to tinker around and absolutely over-engineer everything. Here's a non-exhaustive list of things that a simple-ish website like this does not need but I've played with anyway:

- Page views with [Supabase][supabase] (hosted Postgres) using an RPC
- Syntax highlighting at build-time with [Shiki][shiki]
- Tunneled analytics and error monitoring using [Plausible][plausible] and [Sentry][sentry]
- Data fetching from APIs like [GitHub][github], [Notion][notion] and [Buttondown][buttondown] using [React Query][react-query]
