Here's a couple of other things that I love working with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): can&apos;t believe I put off working on NextJS
  for so long; it is an absolute delight!

- [Styled components](https://styled-components.com): CSS-in-JS _just works_

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): type-safe code means that
  refactoring and catching bugs at code-write time itself becomes the norm

- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org): an opinionated toolset for
  much more efficient redux development

- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint): helps
  you (and your team!) adhere to a commit convention, by checking if your
  commit messages meet the
  [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0)

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io): only thing better than looking at beautiful
  code is not having to worry about formatting it

and a couple of packages that I've been keeping an eye out for:

- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com): makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

- [Rome](https://rome.tools): an approach to "standardizing the web development experience" by consolidating a linter, compiler, bundler, and more for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, Markdown, and CSS.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev): taking the concepts of [Snowpack](https://snowpack.dev) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) to a whole another level

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev): component framework which unlike React and Vue (which primarily run in the browser), runs during the _compile step at build time_

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com): CSS framework with a focus on utility classes instead of prebuilt components
